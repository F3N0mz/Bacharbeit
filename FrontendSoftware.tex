\section{Development of a Remote-APP}
The ground structure of a companion app is 3 context windows that are selectable in the drawer menu. 

The first context window is called \textbf{Device Connection}. It contains the button to scan the environment for all the bluetooth devices, which are listed in the list under the \textbf{Found Devices}. At the very bottom there is also a connection status of the app to the device.

The second window is called \textbf{Device Configuration}. It contains all the settings regarding the configuration of device, such as: Time of dispense, schedule template load/save, view current schedule, ability to edit or delete current schedule, as well as adding new schedule template and the schedule save/load indicator. It also contains the information about on-board clock and the ability to set or change it


The third window is called \textbf{Monitoring \& Status}. It contains all the miscellaneous information about the device such as: Connection status, Last dispensed time, time until next dispense. The device logs are also available there. Logs contain information about bluetooth connection, information about past dispense events.

\subsection{Device Connection}
\subsection{Device Configuration}
  a. Add/Configure Dispense Schedule:
  i. Time of dispense (up to 3 a day). Get current timer/Clock
  ii. Save/Load Schedule. Stored in android app
  
  b. View Current Schedule:
  i. Display a clear list of all programmed dispense times and associated details. (Parse T/C info into Calendar info)
  
  c. Edit/Delete Schedule:
  i. Allow modification of existing schedules (time, days, name).
  ii. Allow removal of unneeded schedules.
  iii. (Important) Ensure changes are reliably sent and confirmed by the dispenser hardware. (ESP32/App T/C Matching)
  
  d. Configure Device Time Get current Clock/Set Current Clock
  
\subsection{Monitoring \&  Status}

a. Device Status Display:
i. Show basic status received from the dispenser:
1. Connected/Disconnected
2. Battery Level (ESP32 Function)
3. Last dispensed time/status (Success/Failure) (Requires Sensor) (Sensor+T/C info)
4. Current time on the dispenser (to check sync) T/C Info
5. Time until next dispense T/C Info

b. Dispense History/Log:
i. Display a log of past dispense events. (Need to configure Logging storage on ESP32, last 30 due to small memory size)
ii. Information per entry: Timestamp, Scheduled Time, Medication Name (if set), Status (e.g., Dispensed Successfully, Failed, Skipped). This is crucial for tracking adherence.
